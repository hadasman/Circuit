synaptic inhibition shapes NMDA spikes, influencing local dendritic
processing and global I/O properties of cortical neurons. Cell Reports
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.10.035

We have used the models of Hay et al., 2011 and of Grunditz et al.,
2008 to study the effect of timed inhibition over the dendritic NMDA
spike.  These code scripts, written in a combination of python and
NEURON, can be used to reproduce the 6 figures from the main text of
the paper (The code for the supplementary figures will be given upon
request).

Questions on how to use this model should be directed to
